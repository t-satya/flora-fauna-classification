Image classification using CNNs | Kaggle competition

This project involves classifying images into 10 biological categories using deep learning. Built as part of a Kaggle competition, it demonstrates end-to-end training and evaluation using PyTorch and EfficientNet.

## Model
- Pretrained **EfficientNet**
- Custom classification head for 10 output classes
- Evaluated using **Weighted F1 Score**

## Dataset
- Images of 10 biological classes (e.g., Mammalia, Plantae, Aves)
- Augmentation: Resize, crop, flip, normalization

## To Do
- Improve model performance
- Add Streamlit/Gradio app for image prediction
- Modularize and clean the code
